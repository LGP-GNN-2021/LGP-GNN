# LGP-GNN
Downloadable code for the experiments in the paper "Graph Neural Networks with Local Graph Parameters"

Steps to run code:
1. Install requirements from requirements.txt.
2. Run download_datasets.sh (located in ./data) !All the different versions of all datasets will take up a lot of space on your disk!. Separate scripts are provided for every datasets!
3. Get the train-val-test pipeline running as in one of the notebooks. Examples are provided to reproduce the best results for every dataset.
